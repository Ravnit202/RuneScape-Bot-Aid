## Overview :crystal_ball:
A simple bot for RuneScape using YoloV5 object detection, image detection, and keyboard & mouse controls. 

## Installation :electric_plug:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Startup :computer:

Once you have ran the RS-BT.exe file, or the main.py file, you should see a window as such:
![Main Window](images/program.PNG "Main Window")

From here, press the "Woodcutting" 
    ![WoodCutting](images/img2.png "Woodcutting") 
button to activate the woodcutting bot. A console should appear and output details about the bot.

## Functionality :scroll:
The bot works in 3 main 'steps'. Note you should move to an area with several trees before running the bot.
### 1. Finding and Cutting Trees ðŸª“
The bot will search for trees and click on a detected tree. Once the cutting period is over, the bot will search for another tree. If no other trees are found, see #3.
### 2. Clearing the Inventory :wastebasket:
Once your inventory is full, the bot will drop all wood logs as if it were a human. Once no more logs are detected in the inventory, the bot will go back to step #1.
### 3. Finding New Trees :eyes:
If the bot does not detect any trees, it will first try moving around, followed by moving the in-game camera if movement does not work.
## Usage :book:
    
Once activated, the bot should automatically tab into RuneScape, if open, or print a message in the console informing you that RuneScape is not open. To turn off the bot, simply hold the "=" key for a few seconds, or close the console.

(Note if you tab back into the main program screen, it may stop responding. However, the bot will continue to run normally as long as you do not terminate the program.)

## Anti Bot Detection :robot:
There are several measures in place to prevent bot detection, and the account used to test the bot has not been banned after ~1month of use, however there is still not a 100% guarantee that your Jagex account will not be banned.

### Measures :page_facing_up:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- There are random actions, such as moving the camera in game, that occur occasionally to simulate a human &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; player.
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Every so often, the bot will print out a message to simulate a human player.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Nearly all delays are randomized and humanized.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Mouse movement is humanized with the pyHM python library.

## Upcoming Features :electron:

### Mining Bot :rock:
A simple Mining Bot
### Fishing Bot :fishing_pole_and_fish:
A simple Fishing Bot
### Pathfinding :running_man:
A way for the bot to deposit materials and move around the map.
