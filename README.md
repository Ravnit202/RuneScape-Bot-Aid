## Overview :crystal_ball:
A simple bot for RuneScape using YoloV5 object detection, image detection, and keyboard & mouse controls. 

## Installation :electric_plug:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Startup :computer:

Once you have ran the RS-BT.exe file, or the main.py file, you should see a window as such:
![Main Window](images/program.PNG "Main Window")

From here, press the "Woodcutting" ![WoodCutting](images/img2.PNG "Woodcutting") button to activate the woodcutting bot. A console should appear and output details about the bot.

## Usage :book:
    
Once activated, the bot should automatically tab into RuneScape, if open, or print a message in the console informing you that RuneScape is not open. To turn off the bot, simply hold the "=" key for a few seconds, or close the console.

(Note if you tab back into the main program screen, it may stop responding. However, the bot will continue to run normally as long as you do not terminate the program.)

## Anti Bot Detection :robot:
Every so often, the bot will print out a message in the game as an additional measure to combat bot detection.
